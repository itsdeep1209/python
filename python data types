Basic Python data types:
a) bool : True or False
True represet value 1 and False represent 0
b) Numbers : Integers , Floating point Decimals
c) Strings
d) Lists
e) Sets
f) Dictionaries
g) Tuples

Strings: A sequence of alphanumeric characters that is terminated with the NUL character

String immutability:
a = "Hello"
b = a 
a = a + "World"
# print(a)
# print(b)

# string slicing:
# <  -1-2-3-4-5  -9
# ->0123456789
#   HELLOWORLD

#   a[1:5] 'ello'
#   a[6:] 'orld'
#   a[6:-1] 'orl'
#   a[:5] 'Hello'

#   list , sets and dictionaries:

# a = []
# b = [1, "string" , True , 2.3]
# list indexing works same as string to get first item in the list access index 0 b[0] to access last item in the list access indes -1 b[-1]
# List slicing also works the same was as String
# b[-3:] : item which starts from -3 till ends.

# to add an additional item in the list

# b.append(test)
# b.insert(2,"test") - will add at index 2
# len(b) - evaluate the staring length
